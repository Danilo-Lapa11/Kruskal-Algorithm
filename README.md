<h1 align="center"> Implementation of the Kruskal Algorithm at airports in the United States</h1>

## :memo: Description
The project conducted as part of the "Algorithms and Data Structures" course in the "Sistemas de Informação" program at the Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE) aimed to develop an algorithm to determine the shortest path within a weighted graph. To accomplish this objective, a graph was constructed using a publicly available dataset obtained from the website https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aravindram11/list-of-us-airports. In this graph, nodes were employed to represent various airports across the United States, while edges were established to signify the distances between these airports. The algorithm chosen for the purpose of identifying the shortest path between two interconnected airports was Dijkstra's Algorithm. The absence of negative weights within the graph facilitated the use of Dijkstra's Algorithm, as the weights were solely derived from the distances separating the individual airports.
